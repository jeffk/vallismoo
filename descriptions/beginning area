You stand on an ironwork grating that spans the room.  Far beneath your feet, ringing the room, lies a gigantic inverted dome.  The dome is entirely translucent, giving way to a breathtaking view of the scenery below.  Puffy clouds float over rolling green medows, deep blue lakes, and crisp white mountaintops.  Patches of brown lie here and there, signs of a growing civilization.  At one end of the valley it meets the ocean, dotted with white froth and tiny islands.  At the other, the harsh and desolate sands of a desert reach to the horizon.There is a large, round desk in the center of the room.  A hand painted sign hanging from it proclaims, "Information".  The four points of the compass lead off into different hallways, signs above each.LoungeA large, cozy room, carved entirely out of stone.  There is a large, round fireplace in the far wall, surrounded by flagstones that radiate warmth.  A cluster of couches and chairs fills the center of the room.  There is a large furry rug on the floor.  A long, wooden bar lines the east wall, with hand-carved barstools lined up infront of it.  There is a large fishtank in the west wall.  A small hallway leads southwards.LibraryThe warm light of a fireplace fills the room with a warm, hearty glow.  Bookshelves line the walls, rising all the way to the ceiling.  A few tomes are spread out on the coffeetable infront of a few comfortable reading couches.  There is a small tea-set there, as well.  A large globe stands off to one side of the room.  Light fills the room from several lamps mounted flush against the wall.  There is a small corridor to the west.GovernmentA busy office, this room is scattered with tables and chairs.  Harried apprentaces shuffle through the room, carrying teetering stacks of paper.  A small sign in the middle of the room reads:  Greivance processing is currently on hold as we reorganize.  We thank you for cooperation.  -The Management  The only obvious exit seems to be a set of double doors to the north.StorageRacks and racks of shelves line this large room.  Every imaginable thing rests upon these shelves.  Weapons, armor, foliage samples, and even critters.  You can hear a few loud squeals from the back, and a few agitated grunts and bellows from underneath one of these shelves.  A few large pots are scattered around.  Things occasionally bubble to the surface, and then submerge themselves again.  It's all very disconcerting.  A small corridor leads eastwards.
