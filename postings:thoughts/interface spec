Interface specification-----------------------What VallisMOO looks like.Rooms-----Rooms should generally be at least two paragraphs, and no more than four paragraphs, broken up thusly:Room TitleDescription Paragraph*Integrated Items*ContentsExitsTry to be curt in your descriptions, and try to make up for limited raw description space by giving variety in day/night/weather/season messages.  Variety is the spice of life, and we've got plenty of space to describe.  What we need is variety, and automated changes.  Stuff that, once described (now quite a lengthy process, considering all the messages), provides the user with new experiences every so often.  The room looks different when it rains, and looks different with a winter mornings snow.The hard and fast rule is that you never send the user a blank line, unless they're reading off a sheet of paper, or listing something OOCly, and you need it for emphasis.  The IC experience should be seamless, with no jarring interruptions.
