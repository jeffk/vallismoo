I'm working on core canon documentation.  The 'Book of the MOO' so to speak.------------------Each race has its own 'religon' that controls how the magic users of that race channel their powers.  Other races can adapt to use the magical order of other races, with varying success.  Snake people users follow the path of the illusionist, worshiping the sand and the mirage.  Human magic users follow the path of the magus, seeking power and general alterationist abilities.  Rock magic users follow the path of the machine, worshiping the great machine below and its creator.  Shapeshifters follow the path of nature, worshiping nature and the earth.In practice, these magical 'paths' work much like the 'schools' in AD&D, or perhaps more like the Disciplines in Vampire: The Masquerade.  Maybe a cross between the two.  Lower level spells are pretty much universal.  Light, dark, spark, are all fairly generic spells.  The higher level the magic user progresses, however, the more the spells diverge.  A high level snake spell may be 'polymorph' while a high level human magic users would have 'fireball'.  A high level shapeshifters might have 'heal group', or something of that ilk.
