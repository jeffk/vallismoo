Revamped boosting/stat system-----------------------------I've been thinking about this alot lately.  I'm thinking of going with a 100 system, with the exact roll mechanic to be worked out, as I test out various scenarios and see what works.  I also want to slow boosting way down, and make training ahabs more prevalent.  You shouldn't boost in combat quickly unless the person you're fighting has 'training' as a skill (which factors into the learning roll), in which case you'll proceed to about 2/3'rd their ability twice as fast as normal, proceed at the regular pace to equal their ability level, and 1/2 speed after that.Sparring with people who have no training ability, you boost at normal speed up to 2/3rd their ability, 1/2 speed to their ability, and 1/4 speed after that.  Two people punching each other who have rougly the same ability scores will take forever to get 'better', while a person who goes off and finds an ahab 'master' to teach him will get better relatively quickly.The IC explination for this is that you get used to their fighting style, and aren't open to a variety of them, thus you don't get much better once you've mastered how to defend against it.Streamlined combat engine-------------------------In the end, there should be one verb for combat permission calls (handling ranged, melee, and brawl attacks), one verb for the combat roll (ditto), and one verb for the combat resolution (ditto).  Spells, monsters, natural phenomenon, etc, should all go through these three verbs.All attacks have the following variables (at least):type: the type of attackdamage type: type of damageattacker: attacker, if anydefender: defenderweapon: weaponarea: optional body area to attackThis way, diseases and poisons can run through the same permission checks.  A poison attack would have the damage type be poison, but the type of attack might be ranged, if someone's shooting a blowgun at them.  That way the verb can factor for damage immunity, or damage vulnerability.It also follows that since we're passing the type of attack, and the type of damage, we can run spells through it.  Attack type 'magic', damage type can be 'cold', 'heat', 'poison', 'blunt', 'edged', or what have you.  A person may be wearing a medalion of cold resistance, in which case the damage taken would be less.Tightly integrated, expandable room generic-------------------------------------------We need a room where players can be in one of three states, normal, invisible, and astral.  When invisible the player is not seen, however the player makes noises, and can speak.  When astral, the player cannot be seen or heard.  All verbs, thereby, are going to need permission checks to make sure the player can actually do a certain thing, like pull the chain, or motion for everyone to follow.We need the usual day/night, weather, and optional resource farming stuff.  As far as resource farming, each room should have a .resources property, which lists the amount of 'resources' it has.  Forests have 'wood' resources, mines have 'coal/diamonds/gold' resources, streams have 'fish' resources, etc.  Each type requires something different to get at them, and different proficiencies.Effects system(?)--------------I haven't looked at Quinns code on this yet, but I'm guessing I'll have to add something.IC/OOC------Essentially, players get moved to the OOC area when they type @ooc, but a 'remnant' is dropped at their last location, which holds their place for them.  This remnant is destroyed when they go back IC.  The remnant (or ghost) recieves damage, which it passes to the player.  The remnant, however, is assumed to be 'hiding', so possibly a skill check should be made by someone trying to hunt them down.Death-----I think a 1 month newbie acclamation time is good, where deaths don't change anything.  After that, depending on the amount of damage, they'll slowly begin to deteriorate.  They loose a bit of their 'soul' every time they die, and after a while, their soul simply gives up the will to keep coming back.  I'm working on an IC explination of this.  I would estimate that the average player would have about 10 'deaths' to go through.  Of course, there would be potions, scrolls, and magical artifacts that could replenish this, but possibly with nasty side-effects.When you die, and you're OOC, you should get a message along the lines of 'you're dead', and you shouldn't be able to go back IC for about a half hour.  If you're IC, you should be disconnected, moved to a spiritual limbo, and if you log in, you should be in the OOC area until about a half hour, when you can go back IC.  (Your body finished re-forming.)NPCs----NPCs are going to be extremely important.  I'm going to say we're going to need at least 2*player population NPCs, and start out at about 45 of them.  We need to populate the major cities, as well as add some NPCs in out of the way locations to use as plot devices.  I'd say a central 'rumors' depository would be a good idea, as well as individual conversation reactors.  I'll write the conversation reactor soon.In cities, and populated areas, I'd like to have city guards.  If someone starts a fight in a populated/trafficed area, the city guard comes and throws them in jail.  After beating the snot out of them, of course.  Peoples rooms, and similar out-of-the-way places wouldn't be considered public, and killing people in their beds is perfectly acceptable game-wise.Karma/Reputation----------------All Characters, whether they be players or NPCs, have karma.  Good karma for the good guys, bad karma for the bad guys.  (We can code magical 'aura sight' spells for this, as well.)  Reputation is how well known they are, as a good or bad guy.  You have two kinds of reputation, area reputation, and national reputation.  If the king decides to bestow on you the honor of marrying his daughter, you get alot of national reputation.  If you kill a peasant, you get negative area reputation.  People in an area will react to you differently based on your reputaion in that area:10 - 7: Treat you with respect, possibly free food.  Little children look at you in awe.  People tell you of their problems, in the hope that you will assist them.6 - 4: People like you, and will support you in a fight.  (IE, attack people who attack you.)3: The bartender greets you.  People treat you normally.2 - -2: People are generally ambivalent towards you.  Reactions mostly effect the rolls for certain things, like intimidation.-3 - -6: People are afraid of you.  They flee when fights break out, and generally fear you.  Evil characters begin to give you the time of day.-7 - -8: People report you to the guard on sight.  People flee, and are easy to intimidate.  Evil characters respect you.-9: There is a bounty on your head.  (A sizeable one.)  Evil characters respect you.  Neutral characters flee.  Good characters attack you.-10: People flee in terror.  There is a bounty the size of a kings ransom on your head.  Good characters attack you on sight.  Neutral characters flee.  Evil characters bow.Characters seperate from the populous generally refer to national reputation, which only varies if you complete quests or kill people of national reputation.  Royalty, high mages, and high-powered NPCs will check against your national reputation.Karma is tracked seperately from reputation, and is a combination of both types of reputation.  It's how bad you really are.  Karma goes up and down alot, depending on your actions.  Killing good/neutral people lowers your karma, taking quests from good characters increases it, killing evil characters increases it, unless you're really evil, and joining evil organizations decreases it.Aura sight reflects your karma.  Someone asking the town gossip about you would reflect your area reputation.  Your standing with the kings personal assistant reflects your national reputation.Help Documentation------------------The help database needs to be merged with the Lambda server 1.8.0r5 server help database, to provide the help files on the new foat based builtins, and the like.  Also, the database needs to be swept for Ghostwheel references, and they need to be removed.Theme-----I'm working on backstory and theme.  Our essentially game 'category' is fantasy middle ages.  Our game world is going to be initially limited to the valley.  If anyone has a big list of good fantasy names, I'd love to see it.  I suck at making these up.The backstory up till now goes something like this:Nearly a thousand years ago, the great mage war was unleashed upon the land.  Sorcerers of great power fought, destroying entire civilizations from the face of the earth.  In the end, none were left, save _______, the magus of _______.  The world had been scorched, razed to the ground.  The last remaining bastion of humanity was a valley, protected by the last magus to fall against _______.  As ______ strode into now dead magus's tower, the magus's last spell, dormant until ______'s entrance, was unleashed.  ________ was caught off guard, and drained of his last ounce of power.  As _______ lay dying, he whispered the words of his last spell, a spell which would lock the valley in time, so he might return once again to seek his revenge.  The winds of death would not visit this valley.  Once taken by the reaper, the residents of this valley would return from the grave, to resume their normal lives.  And with that, he died.The soul can only be revived so many times, however, an life beyond the ripe old age of 100 still eluded all but the most hearty.  Over the next 500 years the valley was in turmoil.  Warlords would raise raiding parties, attack neighboring villages, only to be attacked again by the rising dead.  500 years later, however, a hero came, and united the clans together under one flag.  The hero became king.  King ______, he ruled the valley for 60 years of peace.  The wartorn villages were knit back together, and peace came over the valley.That was 498 years ago.  A hundred years after peace came, the village of _____ was nearly destroyed by a horde of rock-men, beings who rose from the very ground.  The kings son, ________, made peace with the rock-men, who called themselves _______.  The ________ have since become members of the valley community, doing their part by mining the ground from which they spring.  Two hundred years after that, the gate fortress, which protects the valley from the endless desert beyond, was greeted by several strange visitors.  Lizard beings, who came from the wastes.  They, too, have become part of the society, bringing their own magics and tales of what lies beyond the great desert.Since the mage wars of a thousand years ago, magic has slowly returned to men.  Starting with the most trivial of spells, todays mages have brought back the art of the spellcaster.  They continue to search out new spells, and new artifacts, hoping someday to attain the power to revitalize the wastelands which surrounds us.In this effort, a magus named ________ was experimenting with animals and humans, when he accidently created a group of hybrid beings.  A being capable of shifting forms between an animal and a human.  This, only about 40 years ago, is still being debated in the mage community.  It has created, however, a race of shapeshifters, fully capable of reproduction by themselves.  Common shapeshifter types include foxes, squirrels, racoons, wolves, and bears.  They can shift at will between their human and animal forms, however they have no intermidiate form.Races-----Which brings us to our character races.  Here they are, with their various merits and flaws:Human - Standard baselineRock Person - Difficult to deal with neutral humans, high stamina and strength, lower intelligence and dexterity.  Good low-light vision.  Poison resistance.  Heat and cold resistance.Lizard men - Difficulty with neutral humans, high intelligence and dexterity, lower strength.  Infravision.  Heat resistance.  Un-resistant to cold.Shapeshifters - Small magical resistance, merits and flaws depend on animal.  Human form usually takes on one or two animal characteristics.  Foxes may have large tails, and generally red hair.  Bears will be huge people, blacksmiths or other people generally dedicated to their work.  Wolves will be scraggly, with high stamina, and very sociable.  Premature greying, possibly.  Squirrels will be quick, with brown/blonde hair, very sociable.  Tend to be store keepers, or theives.  Racoons are sociable and smart, but not very strong.  Cats are lithe, but not very wise.Character Classes-----------------We've got the following character classes, each perhaps with its own guild or headquarters, or city that's its headquarters.Rogues -> Guides, Mercenaries, Thieves, Bards, WoodsmanTownspeople -> Peasant, Blacksmith, Tailor, Carpenter, Shopkeeper, Prostitute, Tavern Owner, Fisherman, MinerMages -> Healer, Alchemist, MageHQ: Wasteland Fortress -> Mercenaries, HealerHQ: Hamlet -> Bards, Guides, Carpenter, MageHQ: Mining Village -> Woodsman, Blacksmith, Miner, AlchemistHQ: Port City -> Theives, Tailor, Shopkeeper, Prostitute, Tavern OwnerHQ: Fishing Village -> FishermanSupply/Demand/Production------------------------We've got character classes, and so we need for them to be able to do something.  We need to simulate an economy for the players to fit into, even if they don't make up the whole thing.  An example trade goes as follows:Supplier:   Woodsman ->   Carpenter    ->  ShopkeeperItem:       Wood     ->   Furniture    ->  Home Supplier:   Woodsman ->   Carpenter    ->  Fisherman  ->  Tavern OwnerItem:       Wood     ->   Boat         ->  Fish       ->  FoodSupplier:   Miner    ->   Alchemist    ->  Blacksmith ->  MercenaryItem:       Ore      ->   Iron         ->  Sword      ->  BountySupplier:   Woodsman ->   Alchemist    ->  Tailor     ->  ShopkeeperItem:       Animal   ->   Fur          ->  Clothing   ->  GoodsOur raw materials:Animals (pigs/fish/quail/deer/squirrel/bear/etc)->Pelts/Fur  -> Clothing  -> Armor->Meat  ->Rations->Organs  ->PotionsWood->Lumber  ->Furniture  ->Houses  ->Weapons  ->Boats  ->Wagons->FirewoodOre->Iron  ->Weapons  ->Plows  ->Axes  ->Eating Utensils->Jewels  ->Clothing  ->Armor  ->Raw Value->Gold  ->Clothing  ->Raw ValueGrain->Bread->Cotton  ->Clothing  ->Armor  ->Housing (tents)  ->Furniture/Decoration->BeerBerries->Food  ->Provisions->Wine->Clothing Dye  ->Fine Clothing->PotionsStats-----We have three kinds of stats, personal attributes, ability attributes, and injury attributesPersonal:Mental: Intelligence, Wisdom, *WillpowerPhysical: Strength, Dexterity, *StaminaSocial: Charisma, *Appearance, *Karma, *Resources*Used exclusively for rolls, not for abilitiesAbility:Intelligence Related:Spellcraft		Perception		Crafts			Languages	Mage LoreReading/Writing	MathematicsWisdom Related:Natural Lore	History			Training		Gaming		TailoringBlacksmithing	Healing			Mining			Farming		CookingCarpentry		Potion Creation	Hunting			Seafaring	FishingStrength Related:Swimming		RunningDexterity Related:Edged Attack	Blunt Attack	Melee Attack	Dodging		ParryingRanged Attack	Throwing		Lockpick		Pickpocket	StealthClimbingCharisma Related:Etiquette		Singing			Dancing			Seduction	StorytellingStyleAppearance is rolled along with your area reputation, to see whether people you approach like you.  Karma is a seperate issue.  Stamina is rolled when you take damage, and when you carry more than your strength will allow.  Willpower is rolled to resist spells and potions.  Resources is the raw economic weight you have.  A resources rating gives you cash, even if you don't do anything.  It's assumed that you're either making money when you're offline, or there are other people making money for you.Char Gen--------At CharGen, characters will be able to choose from some various options.  Each stage of character generation is seperate.First, they select a race.  The race puts caps and modifiers on their physical attributes.Then, they'll choose their phyical attributes.  They'll have base attributes of 30 (except resources), and 180 points to distribute around.  Att mods are as follows:Human:		No Mods	Max: Int 90, Wis 90, Wil 90, Str 90, Dex 90, Sta 90, Cha 90, App 90, Res 90Lizard:		Intelligence +5, Strength -5, Appearance -10	Max: Int 95, Wis 90, Wil 90, Str 75, Dex 90, Sta 85, Cha 90, App 75, Res 80Rock:		Strength +5, Stamina +5, Appearance -10, Intelligence -5	Max: Int 80, Wis 90, Wil 90, Str 95, Dex 85, Sta 95, Cha 90, App 75, Res 80ShapeshiftersFox:		Intelligence +5, Strength -10, Appearance +5, Wisdom +5	Max: Int 95, Wis 90, Wil 80, Str 75, Dex 95, Sta 85, Cha 90, App 95, Res 70	Animal form: Str -20, Dex +10, Sta -20Wolf:		Dexterity +5, Strength -5, Charisma +5	Max: Int 90, Wis 90, Wil 80, Str 85, Dex 95, Sta 85, Cha 95, App 85, Res 65	Animal form: Str -15, Dex +5, Sta -15Bear:		Strength +10, Intelligence -5, Wisdom +5	Max: Int 85, Wis 95, Wil 80, Str 95, Dex 85, Sta 95, Cha 90, App 90, Res 75	Animal form: Str +10, Dex -10, Sta +10Squirrel:	Strength -5, Wisdom -5, Dexterity +10, Charisma +5	Max: Int 90, Wis 85, Wil 80, Str 75, Dex 95, Sta 75, Cha 95, App 95, Res 85	Animal form: Str -25, Dex +15, Sta -15Racoon:		Strength -5, Wisdom -5, Charisma +5, Intelligence +5	Max: Int 95, Wis 85, Wil 80, Str 85, Dex 90, Sta 85, Cha 95, App 90, Res 80	Animal form: Str -20, Dex +10, Sta -10Cat:		Strength -5, Wisdom -5, Dexterity +10	Max: Int 90, Wis 85, Wil 80, Str 80, Dex 95, Sta 85, Cha 90, App 95, Res 70	Animal form: Str -20, Dex +10, Sta -20(A bear can conceivably have a strength of 105 in bear form, higher than any human could ever have without magical assistance.)An example character would be:Rock Person FighterInt: 25 + 20 = 45 (slightly below average)Wis: 30 + 30 = 60 (slightly above average)Wil: 30 + 20 = 50 (average)Str: 35 + 40 = 75 (above average)Dex: 30 + 40 = 70 (above average)Sta: 35 + 15 = 50 (average)Cha: 30 + 10 = 40 (below average)App: 20 +  5 = 25 (extremely below average)Res: 0  +  0 = 0  (below average)    235 + 180=415By distributing 180 points, the characters are slightly higher in stats than 'normal' average characters.  They are not, however, super-powered monsters.  They're regular people.The third step in Character Generation is ability point distribution.  You get to distribute as many points in a certain ability as you have points in that attribute.  You also get 50 points to spend on other abilities.An example character has the following:Intelligence Related:Perception		20 + 10 = 30Crafts			10Languages		15Wisdom Related:Natural Lore	10Blacksmithing	20Healing			10 + 10 = 20Mining			20Strength Related:Swimming		30Running			45Dexterity Related:Edged Attack	10Blunt Attack	30Melee Attack	30 + 10 = 40Dodging			0  + 20 = 20Charisma Related:Etiquette		10Dancing			10Storytelling	20The character history may be that the character was born to a rock person family, raised to be a mine worker, worked in the mines for several years, before becoming an apprentice in a blacksmiths shop.  After living in the blacksmiths shop for several years, he realized he truly wanted to be a fighter, so he decided to go out on his own with his trusty fists.  He has no income, other than what he makes with his fists and sword.Age---I'm pondering age related effects.  At chargen, you get to choose how old your character is, in years.For every decade over 20 you loose one 'life'.For every five years over 20, you get a -1 to appearance and +1 to resources.For every two years over 20, you get a -1 to strength and dexterity, and a +1 to wisdom.For every year over 20, you get 1 more point to spend on abilities.The max is 85 years old, which would give you a -32 to strength and dexterity, -13 to appearance, +13 to resources, +32 to wisdom, 65 extra points in abilities, and 4 'lives' left.You could still, if you played it right, be a really strong old guy.  It'd be kindof difficult, though.Resolution----------Every action has a target difficult.  You roll your ability + attribute, with a modificaton for high stats.Stat mods:1-35 = stat/736-65 = stat/566-85 = stat/386-100 = stat/2>101 = stat/1.5So, our stats are:Rock Person FighterInt: 45 (9)Wis: 60 (12)Wil: 50 (10)Str: 75 (25)Dex: 70 (23)Sta: 50 (10)Cha: 40 (8)App: 25 (3)Lets say we're rolling for melee combat, we roll dex+melee...Dex: 70 (23)Mel: 40 (8);random(70+40)+23+8;=> 94Lets say we're attacking someone with these stats:Dex: 75 (25)Dod: 30 (4);random(75+30)+25+4;=> 83So we hit them.  On another machine the results came back as 54 and 74, respectively, and we would have missed.  In this scenario, we have a slight edge over them, as our melee is higher than their dodge.  If they had a good dodge (like all good boys and girls do) we would have probably missed.  You can see that characters with really high attributes, in the 90's ranges, are very difficult to fight against.A character's attacking you:Dex: 90 (45)Mel: 50 (10);random(90+50)+45+10;=> 73And our rock person is defending:Dex: 70 (23)Dod: 20 (2);random(70+20)+23+2;=> 31With this combat system, high abilities aren't the only thing that matter.  Armor is extremely important, as is having a good weapon.  Just because you have high stats doesn't mean somebody else can't come along and kick yer little butt.Weapon Specialization---------------------Integrated with the boosting system, we have the weapon specialization system.  Every time you boost with a weapon, your weapon specialization has a 50% chance of going up.  Thus, if you're fighting with a broadsword for a long time, you'll get really good with a broadsword, and that bonus (possibly as high as 50) is added to your attack roll when you use it.You can specialize in as many weapons as you can get your hands on, but you'll only advance when you use it.Encumberance------------Players can carry str*2 in kilograms without getting tired.  They can carry str*3, and bench str*4 if they have to.  How long they can keep it up depends on their stamina.  They can hault that amount for sta/3 minutes.Languages---------The character is assumed to know the native valley tongue.  Additional languages come at every 20 points in linguistics.  These additional languages are FOs, which resemble each language.@lsay I think he's on to us.Prints to those who don't know the lizard language:Slither hisses something in a snakelike voice.And to those who know the lizard language:Slither hisses, "I think he's on to us."The languages are common (everyone knows), lizard, rock person, runic (mages), druidic (healers), bardic, classical, and theif.Lizard and rock person are those races respective tongues.  Runic is the language which magical scripts are written in.  (The player may not read scrolls if he doesn't have reading/writing, and runic.)  Druidic is the language of the ancient druids, the language of the earth, used by healers and alchemists.  Bardic is the bards poetic tongue.  Classical is the equivalent of greek or latin, spoken by the scholars and writers.  Theif is the theives special language, reserved for writing notes to other theives, and communicating in hushed tones in dark alleys.It is assumed that everyone can read and write common, however if you want to read and write other languages, you must have the skill reading/writing, which allows you to read and write in the other languages you know.  If you come across a language that you don't know, it's a roll against a set difficulty to see if you understand it.Stat Advancement----------------Stats advance on successes, not on repeated failure.  It's an action success, though, not necessarily a straight ability success.  You won't be able to do certain things unless you have the required ability score, but there are things you can do without the ability score to advance.0-20:   %20 chance of 1 point boost on successes, limited by 4 hours21-40:  %15 chance of 1 point boost on successes, limited by 6 hours41-60:  %10 chance of 1 point boost on successes, limited by 8 hours61-80:  %5  chance of 1 point boost on successes, limited by 10 hours81-100: %2  chance of 1 point boost on successes, limited by 12 hours>100:   %1  chance of 1 point boost on successes, limited by 24 hoursWith attribute scores, the percentages are halved.  Only one stat boost at a time.The goal here is to discourage sparring, and encourage exploration and communication.  You'll get further by going out and finding a teacher, or paying an NPC to train you, than you will with sparring.Hunger------I do plan on having a hunger system, though I won't have a thirst system.  It doesn't count up the time that you're OOC, or offline, so you're only adding ticks to the 'feed-o-meter' when you're IC and walking around.  This gives players a reason to do something, and something for NPCs to do.  This also gives me a reason to make sure that everyone has a job they can do in an automated fashion.You add 1 to the hunger rating every time your :pulse goes through, and you're IC and online.  Once the hunger rating gets to 150 (12 hours), you start to get hungry.  After 300, you start to get very hungry, and after 450, you start to get minuses to your rolls.  If you get to 1000, you pass out from starvation.  Past 1500, and you die.One ration subtracts 100 from your hunger rating.  Rations can be bought from storekeepers, tavern owners, and some farmers.  You can also get meals in taverns which subtract from your hunger rating.Players do not, however, have to go to the bathroom.  They can, if they want to.Damage------There are three types of damage:Physical Fatigue (Fatigue)InjuryMental Fatigue (Drain)Punching down doors, getting hit with rocks, and getting punched up to a certain level only causes physical fatigue, minor bruises and tired muscles.  Anything less than 15 points of damage goes into the physical fatigue category.  After the physical fatigue gets to 100, everything goes into injury, which is actual damage.  Physical fatigue heals at a rate of 2 per pulse.  (Ie, 1 per every 2.5 minutes, or 20 per hour)  Injury heals at a rate of 1 per 2 pulses.  (Ie, 1 in 10 minutes, or 6 per hour)  Mental fatigue is caused by spells, and inhibits spellcasting and skills that use intelligence and wisdom.  It heals at a rate of 2 per pulse. (Ie, 1 per every 2.5 minutes, or 20 per hour)Physical fatigue applys to pysical rolls only.  Mental fatigue, or drain, applies only to mental rolls.  Injury applies to all rolls.  When either fatigue reaches 100, a roll is made against stamina or willpower, respectively.  If the roll is passed, nothing happens, and everything dumps into injury.  If the rolls is failed, the player passes out until their next pulse.The roll mods are thusly:Fatigue/Drain:0-20:  fatigue/1021-40: fatigue/841-60: fatigue/661-80: fatigue/481-100:fatigue/2Therefor, at 65 physical fatigue, you'd get a -16 to all your physical rolls.Injury:0-20:  injury/521-40: injury/441-60: injury/361-80: injury/281-100:injury/1So, at 90 injury, you'd get a -90 to all your rolls.Weapons do:random(weapon.damage_bonus + attack.damage + (attacker:get_stat(attack.damage_stat)/5) + attacker:get_stat(weapon.special_skill)/4;
