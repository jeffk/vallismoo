The Combat System-----------------The combat system currently in place on this MOO is a much simplified, much streamlined, slightly more expandable combat system than the one which originally ships with the ghostcore.  This combat system breaks things down in an object oriented way, thusly.We have...$combatant'sThese are the people/beings who do the fighting.  They have the following (relatively important verbs) defined on them:kill/attackwieldsheathedie()unconscious()do_metabolism()do_attack()do_defend()take_damage() take_injury() take_drain() take_fatigue()get_resistance()announce_dodge()announce_hit()$weapon'sThese are what the $combatant's wield.  They have several $attacks defined on them.  A broadsword, for example, will have a 'blade slash' $attack defined on it.  $weapons serve primarily as IC placeholders, and as permission checks.  They have the parry modifiers on them.  They have the following verbs:do_attack()announce_parry()$attack'sThis is where the meat is.  These have the majority of the important code defined on them.  An attack, most importantly, has the actually damage/attack code on it.  The verbs:do_attack()roll_attack()special_damage()get_damage()announce_attack()$attack_typesAttack types are the generic kinds of attacks that players can do.  These include magical attacks, bladed attacks, blunt attacks, etc.  It also includes natural attacks, for natural phenomenon.  They serve primarily as matching types in calculating whether something protects against an attack type or not.  Attacks have attack types defined on them, which get passed through the damage calculation.  A spirit probably won't feel too much from a bladed attack, but they might feel a magic attack.$damage'sThese are the generic damage types.  They serve as placeholders for soaking, as well as definers of what kind of damage is caused by an attack.  They also define what special messages might be used, and how much armor soaks for an attack.  A person made of fire won't care about impact damage, but they might care about cold damage.Combat Messages---------------The combat messages are defined as follows:Message   DefinedAttack -> AttackDodge  -> Combatant ($species, really)Hit    -> Combatant ($species, really)Parry  -> WeaponSoak   -> Armor
